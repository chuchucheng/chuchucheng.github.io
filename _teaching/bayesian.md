[This is a basic introduction to Bayesian Statistics for Linguists](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wnlvpysbs4avh2l/introToBayes.pdf?dl=0), which covers the fundamental differences between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics, a very shallow introduction to the Bayes theorem and some additional resources.
