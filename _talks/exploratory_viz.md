Working with data is a kind of interview - it is a complex back-and-forth, drawing out the expressiveness of data. The process is often visual, depending heavily on a sequence of graphical displays, "visualizations." This three-hour workshop will focus on the concepts and skills you need to use data visualization effectively as part of your reporting practice - to conduct a data interview. You will learn how to spot trends, highlight changes over time, identify outliers, make meaningful comparisons, and describe important patterns in your data - all through the effective use of visualization strategies. This class will be based in the R language and distributed through Jupyter notebooks. These pre-built examples can later be customized to suit your own projects when you return to your newsroom.
