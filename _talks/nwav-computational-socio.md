In this talk for the Computational Sociolinguistics workshop, I discuss how to balance three core ideals when collecting data and publishing research. 

* Reproducibility: We want to be able to repeat computational analyses done in the course of research
* Open Science: We want to share data collected as part of research with other researchers and citizen scientists
* Participant privacy: The desire of social media users not to be targeted by researchers & the need to abide by the developer's agreements
